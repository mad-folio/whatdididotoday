Easter monday. Just played minecraft with P&E. This is our weekend routine at the moment. 

The cat was out all last night. At about 1am there was howling, his baby cry and I walked around the barnehage to see where he was. Couldnd find him but he was howling with another cat for a long time. 

Planning to meet up with Edd later on for a kubb rematch if the weather looks ok.
