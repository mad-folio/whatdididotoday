After multiple attempts at this why havent I maanged to maintain writing regularly?

Maybe it is a lack of a theme? Is it a lack of time? Maybe that there is nothing really of ntoe to record?

But what do I like to read? It is alway the little anecdotes and the gossip that is most interesting. So lets just do that. Lets write about the little things, the mundane things that often just get lost. 

And the purpose is to reflect and learn. Maybe never to re-read. And that is ok. It is just the process of writing that is most important. Getting the thoughts on to paper, well digital paper.

So here is what to do:

Write down recipes so that our children can use them again and again. 
Relfect on the day to learn and dump. 
Make notes of interesting snippets that may be useful later.
