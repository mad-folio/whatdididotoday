# Agile Business Processes


Software development has used agile processes and technologies for over 40 years. The principles used were formalised in the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles.html) in 2001. 


Agile processes are used to allow companies to produce value in a small-time span at low cost, in a dyamic environment. 


The processes grew out of a series of challenges: 


* Customer requirements are constantly changing and often needs are not precisely known until the customer interacts with a product. 
* Customer engagement in the design and build process was low and resulted in projects that did not meet customer needs. 
* Budget and deadlines were prioritised to protect the customer for risk of failure. 
* Poor communication between stakeholders through the use of jargon and forming assumptions abotu requirements. 

So I might cite some things [@Shea2014; @Lottridge2012]

n a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole][1], and that means comfort.
