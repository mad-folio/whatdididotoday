# Agile Business Processes

## Background

Software development has used agile processes and technologies for over 40 years. The principles used were formalised in the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles.html) in 2001. 


Agile processes are used to allow companies to produce value in a small-time span at low cost, in a dynamic environment. 


The processes grew out of a series of challenges <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>: 


* Customer requirements are constantly changing and often needs are not precisely known until the customer interacts with a product. 
* Customer engagement in the design and build process was low and resulted in projects that did not meet customer needs. 
* Budget and deadlines were prioritised to protect the customer for risk of failure. 
* Poor communication between stakeholders through the use of jargon and forming assumptions about requirements. 

## Contracts

There are a number of models that can be used when writing agile contracts. 

Large numbers of companies have procuement policies that are tender based, and even in situations where they are not drvien by tendering processes these companies still have that mindset. 

This creates challenges for contract negotiation. First time and material contracts do not share the risk of development. Second conventional contracting methods, such as tendering, are slow and prioritise negotiation over collboration. Third traditional fixed price contracts fail to address changing requirements. 

KPMG <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> suggests that you

* Describe the interactions, not the plan
    * For example How long will the sprints or interactions be?
    * Will testing be a separate activity or will it be part of the sprints?
    * What are the rituals and ceremonies that will be part of the sprints or the iterations?
* Define clear quality standards
    * Bounded context should have a defintion of when it can be deployed. 
    * Importantly the supplier should be accountable for work done but it should be recognised that success is dependant on the customer engagement. 
* Set out the commercial principles immediately
    * Principles agreeing shared risk should be makde upfront.

## What This Means For Dolittle

We can state our commercial plan here

We will charge for three phases of the relationship:

* The discovery phase. 
* The build phase.
* The deployment phase.
