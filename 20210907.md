# Agile Business Processes

## Background

Software development has used agile processes and technologies for over 40 years. The principles used were formalised in the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles.html) in 2001. 


Agile processes are used to allow companies to produce value in a small-time span at low cost, in a dynamic environment. 


The processes grew out of a series of challenges <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>: 


* Customer requirements are constantly changing and often needs are not precisely known until the customer interacts with a product. 
* Customer engagement in the design and build process was low and resulted in projects that did not meet customer needs. 
* Budget and deadlines were prioritised to protect the customer for risk of failure. 
* Poor communication between stakeholders through the use of jargon and forming assumptions about requirements. 

## Contract Principles

There are a number of models that can be used when writing agile contracts. 

Large numbers of companies have procuement policies that are tender based, and even in situations where they are not drvien by tendering processes these companies still have that mindset. 

This creates challenges for contract negotiation. First time and material contracts do not share the risk of development. Second conventional contracting methods, such as tendering, are slow and prioritise negotiation over collboration. Third traditional fixed price contracts fail to address changing requirements. 

KPMG <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> suggests that you

* Describe the interactions, not the plan
    * For example How long will the sprints or interactions be?
    * Will testing be a separate activity or will it be part of the sprints?
    * What are the rituals and ceremonies that will be part of the sprints or the iterations?
* Define clear quality standards
    * Bounded context should have a defintion of when it can be deployed. 
    * Importantly the supplier should be accountable for work done but it should be recognised that success is dependant on the customer engagement. 
* Set out the commercial principles immediately
    * Principles agreeing shared risk should be makde upfront.

## Contract Options

### Time and Materials

#### Pros
Highly flexible with supplier working under customer direction.

Relies on trust between customer and delivery partner.

#### Cons
Customer typically bears the risk of poor quality or under performance.
Supplier may be incentivised to sell time, not to deliver the required outcome.
#### When It Works
Useful for requirements development, where the customer is directing supplier resource in the Scrum team, where there are mixed customer / supplier teams or where flexibility is valued above commercial protection.

### Fixed Price Per Sprint

#### Pros
Supplier can be held responsible for the quality and volume of what it delivers in each sprint.
Simple commercial mechanism-fixed price for the output of a given size of sprint team. Maintains flexibility as scope is defined in sprint, not up front.

#### Cons
Penalties for poor quality can encourage supplier to prioritise quality over velocity.
Supplier is only committed to delivery of sprint backlog as prioritised by the Product Owner, not the wider business EPIC.
#### When It Works
Useful for projects where Supplier is responsible for the Scrum team, and in which requirements are prioritised on a per sprint basis. Provides commercial protection with consequences if quality and velocity standards are not achieved.

### Fixed Price Per Bounded Context

#### Pros
Similar to Fixed Price per Sprint, but supplier is paid based on the number of Story Points delivered.
Payment is proportional to the complexity of work delivered.
#### Cons
Requires customer and supplier to have a common understanding of what value a Story Point represents as typically they are relative rather than absolute measures.
#### When It Works

Useful where there is a strong common understanding of the value of a Story Point and a desire to pay based on output.

### Fixed Price - Outcome Based

#### Pros

Supplier signs up to delivery of the outcome that the customer is seeking to achieve for an agreed price.
Simple commercial mechanism with price tied to an outcome

#### Cons
Difficult to price accurately without significant up front work to define the scope.
Focus on outcome can reduce the customer’s flexibility to change requirements in sprint/programme, and may require the involvement of the Commercial team.

#### When It Works
Useful for projects that require the supplier to be aligned with a pre- defined customer vision that is sufficiently well documented. Provides commercial certainty.

## What This Means For Dolittle

We can state our commercial plan here

We will charge for three phases of the relationship:

* The discovery phase. 
* The build phase.
* The deployment phase.
