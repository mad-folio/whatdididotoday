# Agile Business Processes


Software development has used agile processes and technologies for over 40 years. The principles used were formalised in the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles.html) in 2001. 


Agile processes are used to allow companies to produce value in a small-time span at low cost, in a dyamic environment. 


The processes grew out of a series of challenges <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>: 


* Customer requirements are constantly changing and often needs are not precisely known until the customer interacts with a product. 
* Customer engagement in the design and build process was low and resulted in projects that did not meet customer needs. 
* Budget and deadlines were prioritised to protect the customer for risk of failure. 
* Poor communication between stakeholders through the use of jargon and forming assumptions about requirements. 


There are a number of models that can be used when writing agile contracts <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>
