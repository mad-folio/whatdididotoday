Easter Sunday with Susie and Edd. BBQ, kubb and the baked ricotta and hazelnut cheesecake. It wasnt really much like a cheesecake at all. We put the Easter decorations on it made by Phoebe and Ed from mazipan and formed into carrots. 

The cake isnt like a cheesecake at all. More like a very moist cake with lots of nuts. The ricotta was substituted with homemade paneer from 2 litres of milk and juice of 2 lemons. The milk was boiled and as it came to the boil the lemon juice was thrown in.
