# Effectiveness

I was reading through [Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/p/userleap-and-differentiating-insights-611/comments#comment-1470315) and they talked about “10x designers”. The definition is:


> “The idea of a "10x engineer" is popular in Silicon Valley and is used to refer to a rare engineer who can achieve 10 times more than an average developer.”


Is is possible for someone to be 10 times as effective?

This led to a look at what 10x actually means and where it comes from. It appears to have started with a series of essays from Brooks about how software engineers should operate in a team in a similar way a surgeon would. A lead would direct and do the tricky part of the operation and technicians would assist or clean up. This surgeon performs the 10x effort, ie 10 times ore valuable than the others. As can be seen from this [stack answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/355227) this is massively outdated. 


# Product Management

This looks like a good video as well from [Greg Nash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24F8WlyMR00)

* Metric Movers - These pay the bills and drive the company. 
* Customer Requests - And there maybe some overlap with the metric movers but it is important that they are remembered.  
* Delight - This can create the irrational relationship that you need to beat you competitors. By keeping these secret and having a regular cadence then theyThe toothbrushing test. 


# ArcGIS GeoEvent Server

I have been looking into ArcGIS for another application and found that they have a geo event server. This has some interesting functionality to take real-time geo data and build it into an event platform. Take a look at how they are able to interrogate the event streams. The UI is simple but looks effective. Hopefully some good inspiration for where we are headed. 
 
I have linked to the relevant section in the clip and it is just a few minutes long.
