I was reading through [Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/p/userleap-and-differentiating-insights-611/comments#comment-1470315) and they talked about “10x designers”. The definition is:


> “The idea of a "10x engineer" is popular in Silicon Valley and is used to refer to a rare engineer who can achieve 10 times more than an average developer.”

Is is possible for someone to be 10 times as effective?

This led to a look at what 10x actually means and where it comes from. It appears to have started with a series of essays from Brooks about how software engineers should operate in a team in a similar way a surgeon would. A lead would direct and do the tricky part of the operation and technicians would assist or clean up. This surgeon performs the 10x effort, ie 10 times ore valuable than the others. As can be seen from this [stack answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/355227) this is massively outdated.
