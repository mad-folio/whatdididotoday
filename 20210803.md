# Processing of design sprint information

There are a lot of studies describing the process of building software requirements. A PHD that stands out is [A requirement-driven approach for modelling software architectures](https://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/id/eprint/49248/1/Makoondlall-Y-49248.pdf). This references the cost increases as errors in the desing process flow into production and the cost increases become much higher. See the following diagram.

A proposal to resolve some of these issues is to use natural language processing to extract all the elements of the design and discovery process so that nothing is lost. 

A reference tool for this is [AbstFinder](https://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1023%2Fa%3A1008606521587) but I canÂ´t find any software that includes this. It is possibly just an alogorithm. A mor modern tool could be [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org) from Apache.
